# how to mount server - natilus / file navigator: 

go to "other locations" -> connect to server (at bottom) -> type: smb://duhsnas-pri.dhe.duke.edu/dusom_radonc_floyd/All_Staff
the domain is dhe.duke.edu



# how to mount server - commandline (for commandline based programs to work):

  sudo apt install cifs_utils

  sudo mkdir /mnt/floyd_server/
  sudo mount -t cifs -o user=jl963,domain=dhe.duke.edu //duhsnas-pri.dhe.duke.edu/dusom_radonc_floyd/All_Staff /mnt/floyd_server/
  cd /mnt/floyd_server

##note that server has to be connected on natilus first before any files can be accessed. when this isn't done, there would be a permission issue that can be solved by connecting via file browser first.
